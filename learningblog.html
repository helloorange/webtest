                    <p class="post">Today, I made this blog thing. I was having trouble with flexbox grid at first. I tried to style the layout using percentages, but then I realized that wasn't quite what I wanted, especially on a smaller screen.</p>
                    <p>I'm relatively happy with how this page has been styled so far. I am curious about how other coding languages could augment this blog. I could probably also set up a wordpress if I was feeling CRAZY.</p>
                    <p>Shout out to <a href="coolors.io">coolors</a> for the sweet, sweet color inspiration.</p>
                    <p>Another note: I changed <span class="code">border-radius</span> to rems, not ems. That way, they are all consistent across the page, although the boxes of the content are various sizes.</p>
                    <p>I know that the indents on these paragraps are not necessarily good grid design, but I really feel the shorter columns are easier on the eyes.</p>
